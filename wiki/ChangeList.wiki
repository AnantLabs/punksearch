= 0.6.3 (2007-08-20) =
  * core: internal refactorings
  * search: simple (i.e. with predefined filters, like "films") search query relaxed: it is not required for term to match filename, it should at least match filepath; _this particularly useful then you search for singer or album, while no any file inside a folder contains singer name or album title_

  * core: file extensions updated (both indexer "good" extensions and search filters)
