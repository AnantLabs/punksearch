= Introduction =
It was interesting to check the application throughput on heavy load setting.

= Environment =
I modelled the setting as follows:
|| *Index* || 944429 items including folders and files (average local network), 160Mb on disk ||
|| *Hardware* || AMD Duron 1000Gz, 256Mb, 7200 rpm ||
|| *Software* || Debian GNU/Linux, Java 1.5, Tomcat 5.5 ||

= Tools =
Apache JMeter

= Experiments =
10 users, 100 requests for each, 1 sec ramp-up period.

I searched for "potter" in _everything_.
Resulting graph is following:
