#
# The properties are subject to change and don't guaranteed to work.

# Specify in command-line to override web.xml's value
org.punksearch.home=path (by default is not set)

# Show Lucene's scores of found items in the web interface
org.punksearch.web.showscores=true|false (default false)

# Boost by path deep (shorter path - more scores). directories & files
# boost /= 2^(directories in path)
org.punksearch.crawler.boost.deep=true|false (default true)

# Boost by create date (most recent items pop up). files only
# boost *= (1+const/(now-createdate))
org.punksearch.crawler.boost.createdate=true|false (default true)

# Boost by size (big directories pop up). directories only
# boost *= (sizeinbytes/1000) 
org.punksearch.crawler.boost.size=true|false (default true)

# Adjust term lengths during crawl
# Drop filename parts shorter than specified.
# Theoretically low values may affect performance.
org.punksearch.crawler.termlength=number (default 3)

# Adjust term lengths during search
# All user query terms shorter than this value will be ignored during search
# Theoretically low values may affect performance.
# Setting this value less than the value for crawler (above) will not work as expected.
# You should adjust crawler property also and re-crawl the network first.  
org.punksearch.search.termlength=number (default 3)

# Tricky property. You'd better leave it as is ;)
# Small values may lead to exceptions in Lucene search engine on some hard queries
# Large values may lead to out of memory exceptions. 
org.punksearch.search.clauses=number (default 10000)

# The path to use to create temp files during crawling.
# By default (empty value) system's temporary directory to be used (/tmp on UNIX)
org.punksearch.crawler.tmpdir=path (default is empty string)

# Count of threads to use for online status checking for search results
org.punksearch.online.threads=number (default 10)

# Timeout (in seconds) for status cache to refresh

# Try to crawl SMB shares for hosts
org.punksearch.crawler.smb.enabled=true|false (default true)

# Try to crawl FTP shares for hosts
org.punksearch.crawler.ftp.enabled=true|false (default true)

# Whatever collect headers for files at all 
org.punksearch.crawler.header.use=true|false (default true)

# Length of headers to collect

# Trigger header collecting for files with size > than specified
org.punksearch.crawler.header.threshold=number (default 500000)
